# Project1 : Stockscape - Portfolio Analysis in the Socio-Economic Playground 
## Project Scope 
Our project focuses on optimizing portfolio performance by analyzing six industries' performance over the past five years. We aim to validate trends in our data based on the social,political, and economic climate during this period. This analysis will provide investors with insights on portfolio positioning to safeguard their investments. Additionally, we will emphasize geographic data to visualize regions with the highest unemployment rates and cross-reference them with relevant industries.
